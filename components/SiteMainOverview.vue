      <p>We are an independent group of designers and developers in the Kansai (Osaka/Kyoto) area of Japan.</p>
      <p>To practice our English presentations skills, learn new things and meet other people we are organizing IRL (in-person) events.</p>
      <p>All our events are organized by volunteers. Any money that we collect is just to cover our costs.</p>
