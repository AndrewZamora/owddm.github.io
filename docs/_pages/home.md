    excerpt: ' <blockquote>I was really impressed by the volume of really engaged meetup members at an all English language web development meetup in Japan. I came out to give a brief talk for the November 2015 meetup and was really delighted by the level of interaction with the speakers and the attendees, the thoughtful and information heavy debates between attendees and the planning that went into the logistics of the event</blockquote>'
